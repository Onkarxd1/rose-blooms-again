          <span>Noob,</span>
          <br />
          Been a month now <br />since you had disappeared.
          People always say everyone sees the rose not it's thorns but i 
          always thought that's such bullshit like everyone sees it's thorns
          all just to look and be different not appreciating the beauty 
          thr flower gives off.Therefore nab don't let other's words
          get to you be it people from your past whom you once
          considered friend or be it your parents.The "ROSE" Blooms
          brighter and beautiful every time it's about to be cut off.
